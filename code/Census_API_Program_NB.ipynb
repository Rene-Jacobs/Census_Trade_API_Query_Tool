    "## US Census International Trade API Retrieval and Processing Program\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is designed to interact with a Census API, allowing for the retrieval of specific datasets based on user input. It's structured to guide users through a series of questions to pinpoint the exact data they need, including determining the correct API endpoint and the parameters that define their query. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Endpoint Selection:** The program prompts the user with questions to accurately determine the most relevant API endpoint for their data needs.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning Option:** Before saving the data, users have the choice to perform data cleaning operations, allowing for the removal of irrelevant or corrupt data, ensuring the dataset's quality.\n",
    "- **CSV Export:** The final dataset can be saved directly to a CSV file. Users can choose between saving the raw data directly from the API or the cleaned data after processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Interaction:** The program starts by asking the user a series of questions. These questions are designed to gather information about the type of data the user is interested in. This step is crucial for determining the appropriate API endpoint and the necessary parameters for the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **API Call:** Based on the user's input, the program constructs a query and makes a call to the specified Census API endpoint. This step involves fetching the data from the Census database that matches the user's specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Processing:** Once the data is retrieved, the user is presented with the option to clean the data. This step involves filtering out unnecessary or irrelevant information and correcting any discrepancies, ensuring the dataset's accuracy and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Export to CSV:** The final step involves exporting the processed data to a CSV file. The user can choose to save the raw data as it was retrieved from the API or the cleaned data. The CSV file is then stored in a specified location, making it accessible for further analysis or reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure you have the necessary API key and permissions to access the Census data.\n",
    "- Run the program and follow the on-screen prompts to input your data requirements.\n",
    "- Choose between cleaning the data or saving the raw data directly.\n",
